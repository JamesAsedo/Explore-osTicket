<h1>osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle: Intake Through Resolution</h1>
This project demonstrates the end-to-end lifecycle of an IT support ticket using osTicket, an open-source help desk and ticketing system. The lab simulates how enterprise IT service desks manage incidents from initial user intake through investigation, communication, escalation, and resolution.<br/>
<br/>
The environment was deployed in Microsoft Azure to reflect modern, cloud-hosted IT operations.<br/>

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- osTicket (Open-source ticketing system)
- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop Protocol
- Internet Information Services (IIS)
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>Ticket Lifecycle Stages</h2>

- Intake
- Assignment and Communication
- Working the Issue
- Resolution

<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

</p>

<h3 align="center">Ticket assignment</h3>
<p>
  <h4>Support request is received and reviewed by Lead Support/Queue Manager.</h4>

  <h4>Queue manager determines the severity of the issue and assigns the ticket to a department, an agent, a priority level, and an SLA Plan</h4>

</p>

<h3 align="center">Communication</h3>
<p>
  <h4>Agent receives ticket and posts a response and Ticket Status.</h4>

</p>

<h3 align="center">Resolution</h3>
<p>
  <h4>Agent will resolve ticket based on company guidelines and SLA Plan. When a ticket is resolved, the agent will change the "Ticket Status" to resolved.</h4>

<h2>What I Accomplished</h2>
In this lab, I walked through and documented the complete ticket lifecycle within osTicket, including:<br/>
<br/>

- Created a user-submitted support ticket to simulate a real help desk request<br/>
- Reviewed and triaged incoming tickets as a queue manager / lead support role<br/>
- Assigned tickets based on severity, department, agent, priority, and SLA plan<br/>
- Demonstrated agent-to-user communication using internal ticket threads<br/>
- Managed ticket status changes from open → in progress → resolved<br/>
- Closed tickets in accordance with defined company guidelines and SLA requirements<br/>

This workflow mirrors real-world service desk processes used in enterprise and government IT environments.<br/>

<h2>Skills Highlighted</h2>

- IT service desk operations and ticket lifecycle management<br/>
- Incident triage and prioritization<br/>
- SLA-driven support workflows<br/>
- Inter-team communication and escalation<br/>
- Documentation and status tracking<br/>
- Cloud-based system usage<br/>
- Professional IT support practices<br/>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
This project demonstrates practical experience with incident handling and ticket-based support workflows.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than focusing only on technical tools, this lab highlights my understanding of how IT teams operate under SLAs, manage communication with users, and ensure timely issue resolution.<br/>
<br/>
It shows that I can function effectively in structured, process-driven IT environments, supporting users while maintaining accountability, documentation, and service quality.<br/>
<br/>

This concludes the project on the lifecycle of tickets on the osTicket system. I hope that you gained some insight on the workings and lifecycle of tickets in the osTicket system. Thank you for stopping by and checking out this project. Have a wonderful day!
